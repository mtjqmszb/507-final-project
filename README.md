# üéÆ Steam Game Recommendation & Network Explorer

## Overview

This project builds a **graph-based recommendation system** using real Steam user recommendation data. By analyzing how players co-recommend games, we create a network where:

- **Nodes** = Games
- **Edges** = Games recommended by the same users
- **Edge Weights** = Number of shared recommending users

The program allows users to explore relationships between games through a command-line interface (CLI), offering features like game recommendations, shortest paths between games, and identifying the most influential games.

## Features

- üîó **Recommend Similar Games**  
  Get top related games based on shared player recommendations.

- üß≠ **Find Shortest Path Between Two Games**  
  Discover how two games are connected through player behavior.

- ‚≠ê **Identify Most Influential Games**  
  Uses PageRank to find central "hub" games in the network.

- üîç **Search for Game IDs by Name**  
  Easily look up a game's ID using partial name search.

## üìÇ Data Download

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to GitHub's file size limitations.  
> Please download it directly from Kaggle using the link below.

This project uses the publicly available **Game Recommendations on Steam** dataset from Kaggle:

[Game Recommendations on Steam Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/game-recommendations-on-steam)

### Instructions:
1. Download the dataset ZIP file from Kaggle.
2. Extract the contents into a folder named `data` at the root of this project.

Your folder structure should look like this:

```bash
steam_game_network_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recommendations.csv
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ games.csv
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ games_metadata.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ graph_builder.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The program processes a limited number of users (`max_users = 1,000,000`) for efficiency. Only games present in the recommendation data will appear in the network.
