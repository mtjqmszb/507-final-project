# üéÆ Steam Game Recommendation & Network Explorer

## Overview

This project builds a **graph-based recommendation system** using real Steam user recommendation data. By analyzing how players co-recommend games, we create a network where:

- **Nodes** = Games
- **Edges** = Games recommended by the same users
- **Edge Weights** = Number of shared recommending users

The program allows users to explore relationships between games through a command-line interface (CLI), offering features like game recommendations, shortest paths between games, and identifying the most influential games.

## Features

- üîó **Recommend Similar Games**  
  Get top related games based on shared player recommendations.

- üß≠ **Find Shortest Path Between Two Games**  
  Discover how two games are connected through player behavior.

- ‚≠ê **Identify Most Influential Games**  
  Uses PageRank to find central "hub" games in the network.

- üîç **Search for Game IDs by Name**  
  Easily look up a game's ID using partial name search.
